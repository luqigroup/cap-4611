    "text": "Description\nWe introduce basic principles and techniques in the field of machine learning. These are some of the key tools behind the emerging field of data science. These techniques now run behind the scenes to discover patterns and make predictions in various applications in our daily lives. We focus on many of the core machine learning technologies, with motivating applications from a variety of disciplines.\nThe material for this course—including slides, homework assignments, and the overall website structure—is adapted from Mark Schmidt’s CPSC 340: Machine Learning and Data Mining course at the University of British Columbia, used with his permission. We are grateful for his contribution in providing foundational material that helped shape this course."

A introductory book that covers many (but not all) the topics we will discuss is the Artificial Intelligence book of Rusell and Norvig (AI:AMA) or the Artificial Intelligence book of Poole and Mackworth. More advanced books include The Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL) by Hastie et al., Murphy’s Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective (ML:APP) which can be accessed through the library, and Bishop’s Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (PRML)."
